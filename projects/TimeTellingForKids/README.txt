3. Project Description: This is not a digital clock, but a clock that uses hands to tell time. Build a JavaScript game out of determining time based on their hands. How you make this game fun, interesting, and how it overall runs is up to you. The application should also ask for the students first and last name so that the teacher can track the students’ progress for that day. Since many students will be using the same program on a single computer, enable the protected ability to display the overall student performance for all students for that day. (Protected meaning that the data is protected by some means so students can’t get to it.)
For this project, you will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There will be no other programming language in this. All data items will be handled by JavaScript. Consider this as an application that will be run on one computer once a day and the data collected by the instructor or teacher at the end of the day.
